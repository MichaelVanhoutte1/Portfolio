    "aboutMeQuickStory": "<span>I was introduced to computers at 6 years old.</span>  As a child, I often played video games and from the fascination in how they worked, I started making them myself. From simple games and animations, I moved on to building simple websites. In high school, I worked my way up from electricity to computer science. <span>I learned how to code and felt like I had finally found my passion.</span> From that background, doing a <span>bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Science</span> was a great way to further immerse myself in the subject matter. <span>I haven't stopped learning and creating since then.</span> I'm involved in multiple projects and I'm always looking for new challenges. <br/><br/>In the last few years, I have been increasingly <span>working on software development both in my professional and personal life</span>. I've been lucky to have worked alongside senior developers and designers, who have taught me what's expected from a quality product.<br/><br/>",

I might put something together as quickly as possible to make it work, but afterwards I like to spend a good amount of time commenting and organizing everything so that it's <span>easy to understand and maintain.</span><br/><br/><span>Clean, consistent, readable and maintainable code.</span> It's great when features work, but it's even greater when they continue working, regardless of who's working on them. That's why I always try to write tests for my code. It's a great way to make sure that everything works as expected and that it will continue to work in the future.<br/><br/>I'm always excited to work on new projects.

    "spinakerIntro": "In early February I caught wind of an opportunity to go to Poland with some other student from my College to participate in a project called Spinaker. To apply for this project you had to write an extensive essay on why you wanted to participate in this project and what you could bring to the table. <span>The selection was based on your essay and previously achieved grades.</span> Some weeks later I got the news that I was selected to participate in this project.The project would take place from the 4th until the 9th of April.",
    "spinakerGoal": "When I arrived in Katowice I was greeted by the other students that were selected to participate in this project.  <span>We were all from different countries and had different backgrounds.</span> Some of the students were fellow software engineers and some others were studying marketing or business. We started the day of by getting to know each other a bit better over breakfast. After breakfast we were divided into groups and were assigned a mentor. My group was <span>tasked with creating a web application for the school</span> that was hosting the project. The website would allow the student of marketing and business to test out their use cases in an interactive environment.",
    "spinakerCourse": "The remainder of the week was spent working on the website. We had to <span>create a design for the website and then implement it. </span>We had to take into account the use cases that the students of marketing and advertising had to test out. Together with our mentor we <span>created a workflow that would allow us to work efficiently. </span>We used the <span>agile methodology</span> to create the website. We had daily standups and we used the scrum board to keep track of our progress. In the end we were able to create a website that was able to test out the use cases. ",
    "spinakerResult": "This project was a great experience. <span>I was able to work with students from all over Europe and I was able to learn a lot about the agile methodology. </span>Not only was the project a great experience but I also got to visit the beautiful city of Katowice and made some new friends from all over Europe who I will visit later this year.Definitely a recommendation for anyone who is interested in software development and wants to learn more about marketing and business.",

    "commonEuropeTitle": "Common Europe Congress 2022",
    "commonEuropeIntro": "I’ve <span>always had a deep interest for IT</span> and everything within it. When I first heard about the IBM congress in Alicante I was very excited to learn about everything it had to offer. In the education I got from my college, we don’t learn about infrastructure, databases, and power systems in the same way that companies do. That made this an <span>amazing learning opportunity</span> to better my knowledge in these subjects.",
    "commonEuropeGoal": "Before attending such an event, I had a thorough look at everything it had to offer. <span>The main goal was to learn as much as possible in useful subjects. </span>I took a particular interest in three different sessions. The first one was about the Data centric - Moving Business Logic into the Database. I was very interested in this subject because it <span>made me think outside of the box.</span> Normally you would think application-centered and not database-centered. Or at least not in the same way. <br><br>The second subject I took interest in was about <span>Kafka and Node.js.</span> I had a basic understanding of Node.js but I wanted to learn more about it. I hadn't heard about Kafka yet and was very excited to hear that it helped with integrating event streaming platforms with Javascript. <br><br>The last subject was about <span>DevSecOps.</span> I didn't have much knowledge about this subject but I was very interested in it. <span>I wanted to learn more about it and how it could help me in the future.</span> The DevSecOps was specifically on IBM systems, which i've never been able to interact with before. That definitely made it more interesting.",
    "commonEuropeCourse": "When we arrived at the congress, we were greeted by the IBM staff. They were very friendly and made us feel welcome. We were given a tour of the congress and were shown where everything was. After that they gave us a schedule of all the sessions that were going to take place. We were able to choose which sessions we wanted to attend. They also gave us a badge that we could use to scan in and out of the sessions. <br><br><span>I attended a total of 3 sessions.</span> All of them were very interesting and I learned a lot from them. I was able to take a lot of notes and I was able to ask questions to the speakers. I also participated in some leisure activities of the congress, such as golfing. <span>I was able to meet a lot of new people and make some new friends.</span> We finished the congress with a nice dinner and a party.",
    "commonEuropeResult": "I was able to learn a lot at this congress, not only about IBM infrastructure and systems, but also about the Spanish culture and the city of Alicante. <span>The congress allowed me to meet new people and put a foot in the door of IBM.</span> I hope to be able to work with IBM systems sometime in the future.",

    "portfolioGoal": "This website was intended to be a simple personal project where I display some of the projects which I have developed and show who I am as a person. Later on I decided to add a blog section to the website where I could write about <span>my experiences as a software engineer</span> and share some of the knowledge I have gained over the years. I also decided to add translations to the website so that it would be accessible to a wider audience. <br/><br/>In general I wanted to <span>add as much useful functionality as possible to further learn about different technologies</span> that I was using.",
    "portfolioStack": "For this project I wanted to go with a framework that would allow me to create <span>a website that is fast and SEO friendly</span>. Next.js is a great framework for that purpose. Next.js has SSR (Server Side Rendering) which allows your website to be rendered on the server side instead of on the client side. This makes it so that <span>when a user visits your website, the content is already there</span> and the user doesn't have to wait for the content to be loaded. I added styled-components to the project to make it easier to style the website. I also added a few other libraries to the project to make it easier to create certain components. For example I used react-helmet-async to <span>add meta tags and page titles to the website to optimize my SEO and SEA.</span> I chose these technologies not only for the advantages they bring but also because <span>I wanted to learn more about them.</span>",
    "portfolioFurther": "I think for the time being I don't have any plans to add any new features to this website. I might add a few more projects to the website and add some blog posts.
