    I started with simple games and animations, and then moved on to building websites. I love the feeling of creating something from scratch and seeing it come to life.

    aboutMeQuickStoryTitle: `My quick story`,
    aboutMeQuickStory: `<span>I was introduced to computers at 6 years old.</span> Back then I only played videogames, 
    but as I grew older I started to get interested in how they worked. I started with making simple games and animations,
    and then moved on to building simple websites. When I went to secondary school <span>I started to learn how to properly code</span>. Coming from that background,
    doing a bachelor in computer science was a great way to learn more about the field and to get a better understanding of it. <br/><br/>
    
    <span>I haven't stopped learning and creating since then.</span> I'm involved in multiple projects and I'm always looking for new challenges.<br/><br/>
    
    In the last few years, I have been increasingly <span>working on software development both in my professional and personal life</span>. 
    I've been lucky to have worked alongside senior developers and designers, who have taught me what's expected from a quality product.<br/><br/>`,
    aboutMeAsDeveloperTitle: `As a developer`,
    aboutMeAsDeveloper: `I pay close <span>attention to the readability of my code</span>. I might put something together as quickly as possible to make it work, but afterwards I like to spend
    a good amount of time commenting and organizing everything so that it's <span>easy to understand and maintain.</span><br/><br/>
    
    <span>Clean, consistent, readable and maintainable code.</span> It's great when features work, but it's even greater when they continue working, regardless of who's working on them.
    That's why I always try to write tests for my code. It's a great way to make sure that everything works as expected and that it will continue to work in the future.<br/><br/>
    
    I'm always excited to work on new projects. They allow me to <span>learn something new every time</span>. I'm excited to see what the future holds.`,
    aboutMeAsPersonTitle: `As a person`,
    aboutMeAsPerson: `I'm a very <span>social and resourceful person</span>. I love to meet new people and learn about their lives. 
    I love taking a problem and breaking it into smaller bits to find a solution. I'm always open to new experiences and I'm always looking for new challenges.<br/><br/>
    
    <span>I'm very disciplined by nature and I love to keep myself busy.</span> Time is precious and I try to make the most of it. That's why I always try to invest it wisely on either learning or 
    making memories with people close to me.`,
    aboutMeAsColleagueTitle: `As a colleague`,
    aboutMeAsColleague: `<span>I'm a team player</span>, I feel comfortable interacting with both the <span>technically oriented</span> people as well as the <span>artistically oriented</span> ones.
    I will always try to go the extra mile to help my team.<br/><br/>
    
    My communication skills are excellent. I'm always open to feedback and I'm always willing to listen to other people's opinions. These experiences have made me feel comfortable 
    at <span>conveying ideas and explaining my thought process in a way everybody can understand.</span><br/><br/>
    
    My experience working for smaller companies have given me exposure to all the different aspects of a project. <span>I've been involved in the design, development and deployment of multiple projects.</span>
    I've also been lucky enough to be involved in the business side of things, which has given me a better understanding of how a company works.<br/><br/>
    
    I'm always <span>excited to learn new things and meet new people</span>, so be sure to reach out if you want to get to know me better or work together.`,

    spinakerTitle: `Spinaker project Katowice`,
    spinakerIntro: `In early february I caught wind of an opportunity to go to Poland with some other student from my College to participate in a project called Spinaker. 
        To apply for this project you had to write an extensive essay on why you wanted to participate in this project and what you could bring to the table. 
        <span>The selection was based on your essay and previously achieved grades.</span> Some weeks later I got the news that I was selected to participate in this project.
        The project would take place from the 4th until the 9th of april.`,
    spinakerGoal: `When I arrived in Katowice I was greeted by the other students that were selected to participate in this project. 
        <span>We were all from different countries and had different backgrounds.</span> Some of the students were fellow software engineers and some others were studying marketing or business.
        We started the day of by getting to know eachother a bit better over breakfast. After breakfast we were divided into groups and were assigned a mentor.
        My group was <span>tasked with creating a web application for the school</span> that was hosting the project. The website would allow the student of marketing and advertising 
        to test out their use cases in an interactive environment.`,
    spinakerCourse: `The remainder of the week was spent working on the website. We had to <span>create a design for the website and then implement it.</span>
        We had to take into account the use cases that the students of marketing and advertising had to test out. Together with our mentor we <span>created a workflow that would allow us to work efficiently.</span>
        We used the <span>agile methodology</span> to create the website. We had daily standups and we used the scrum board to keep track of our progress. 
        In the end we were able to create a website that was able to test out the use cases. `,
    spinakerResult: `This project was a great experience. <span>I was able to work with students from all over Europe and I was able to learn a lot about the agile methodology. </span>
        Not only was the project a great experience but I also got to visit the beautiful city of Katowice and made some new friends from all over Europe who I will visit later this year.
        Definitely a recommendation for anyone who is interested in software development and wants to learn more about marketing and advertising.`,

    commonEuropeTitle: `Common Europe Congress 2022`,
    commonEuropeIntro: `I’ve always had a deep interest for IT and everything
    within it. When I first heard about the IBM congress in Alicante I was very excited to learn about
    everything it had to offer. In the education i already had, we don’t learn about infrastructure, databases,
    and power systems in the same way that companies do. That made this an amazing learning
    opportunity to better my knowledge in these subjects.`,
    commonEuropeGoal: `Before attending such an event, I had a thorough look at everything it had to offer. The main goal was to learn as much as possible in usefull subjects.
    I took a particular interest in three different sessions. The first one was about the Data centric - Moving Business Logic into the Database. 
    I was very interested in this subject because it made me think outside of the box. Normally you would think application-centered and not database-centered. Or atleast not in the same way.
    
    The second subject I took interest in was about Kafka and Node.js. I had a basic understanding of Node.js but I wanted to learn more about it.
    I hadn't heard about Kafka yet and was very excited to hear that it helped with integrating event streaming platforms with Javascript.
    
    The last subject was about DevSecOps. I didn't have much knowledge about this subject but I was very interested in it. I wanted to learn more about it and how it could help me in the future.
    The DevSecOps was specifically on IBM systems, which i've never been able to interact with before. That definitely made it more interesting.`,
    commonEuropeCourse: `When we arrived at the congress, we were greeted by the IBM staff. They were very friendly and made us feel welcome. We were given a tour of the congress and were shown where everything was.
    We were also given a schedule of all the sessions that were going to take place. We were able to choose which sessions we wanted to attend. We were also given a badge that 
    we could use to scan in and out of the sessions. This was very useful because it allowed us to keep track of the sessions we attended and the ones we didn't. 
    I attended a total of 3 sessions. All of them were very interesting and I learned a lot from them. I was able to take a lot of notes and I was able to ask questions to the speakers.
    I also participated in some leisure activities of the congress, such as golfing. I was able to meet a lot of new people and make some new friends. We finished
    the congress with a nice dinner and a party.`,
    commonEuropeResult: `I was able to learn alot at this congress, not only about IBM infrastructure and systems, but also about the Spanish culture and the city of Alicante.
    The congress allowed me to meet new people and put a foot in the door of IBM. I hope to be able to work with IBM systems sometime in the future.`,
    commonEuropeRecap: `A recap about the Common Europe Congress 2022 hosted in Alicante, Spain. Where I was selected with 20 other students from all over Europe to participate in the congress. 
    The congress was held from the 13th to the 16th of June 2022.`,

    portfolioIntro: `As a software engineer it's very important to be able to properly present yourself and show that you are capable in <span>creating complex web solutions.</span>
    What better way is there than to create a website designed specifically for that purpose. I developed this website to showcase my skills and previous projects,
    so that it might help my future employer to get a <span>better understanding of who I am and what I can do.</span>`,
    portfolioGoal: `This website was intended to be a simple personal project where I display some of the projects which I have developed and show who I am as a person.
    Later on I decided to add a blog section to the website where I could write about <span>my experiences as a software engineer</span> and share some of the knowledge I have gained over the years.
    I also decided to add translations to the website so that it would be accessible to a wider audience. <br/><br/>
    
    In general I wanted to <span>add as much useful functionality as possible to further learn
    about different technologies</span> that I was using.`,
    portfolioStack: `For this project I wanted to go with a framework that would allow me to create <span>a website that is fast and SEO friendly</span>. 
    Next.js is a great framework for that purpose. Next.js has SSR (Server Side Rendering) which allows your website to be rendered on the server side instead of on the client side.
    This makes it so that <span>when a user visits your website the content is already there</span> and the user doesn't have to wait for the content to be loaded. I added styled-components to the project
    to make it easier to style the website. I also added a few other libraries to the project to make it easier to create certain components. For example I used react-helmet-async
    to <span>add meta tags and page titles to the website to optimise my SEO and SEA.</span> I chose these technologies not only for the advantages they bring but also because 
    <span>I wanted to learn more about them.</span>`,
    portfolioFurther: `I think for the time being I don't have any plans to add any new features to this website. I might add a few more projects to the website and maybe add a few more blog posts.
    I'm still considering <span>adding a few more languages to the website</span> but I'm not sure if I will do that. I might also add a few more pages to the website to make it more interesting.`,
