# Developer Portfolio
This project is a personal website for me, designed to showcase my projects and skills and give a better look into who I am as a person. Next to that I also put blogposts on the website to share my experiences and newfound knowledge on certain topics.

## Getting Started
<h4>1. Clone this repository:</h4>

```
git clone git@github.com:MichaelVanhoutte1/portfolio.git portfolio

cd portfolio
```
<h4>2. Install the dependencies and start the local server.</h4>

On the command line, run:
```
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```
Open your browser on localhost:3000. This will take you to the homepage.

<h4>3. Next time you want to open the app.</h4>

On the command line, run:
```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
