I started with making simple games and animations,\n    and then moved on to building simple websites. When I went to secondary school <span>I started to learn how to properly code</span>. Coming from that background,\n    doing a bachelor in computer science was a great way to learn more about the field and to get a better understanding of it. <br/><br/>\n    \n    <span>I haven't stopped learning and creating since then.</span> I'm involved in multiple projects and I'm always looking for new challenges.<br/><br/>\n    \n    In the last few years, I have been increasingly <span>working on software development both in my professional and personal life</span>. \n    I've been lucky to have worked alongside senior developers and designers, who have taught me what's expected from a quality product.<br/><br/>",

It's a great way to make sure that everything works as expected and that it will continue to work in the future.<br/><br/>\n    \n    I'm always excited to work on new projects.

    "spinakerGoal": "When I arrived in Katowice I was greeted by the other students that were selected to participate in this project. \n        <span>We were all from different countries and had different backgrounds.</span> Some of the students were fellow software engineers and some others were studying marketing or business.\n        We started the day of by getting to know eachother a bit better over breakfast. After breakfast we were divided into groups and were assigned a mentor.\n        My group was <span>tasked with creating a web application for the school</span> that was hosting the project. The website would allow the student of marketing and advertising \n        to test out their use cases in an interactive environment.",
    "spinakerCourse": "The remainder of the week was spent working on the website. We had to <span>create a design for the website and then implement it.</span>\n        We had to take into account the use cases that the students of marketing and advertising had to test out. Together with our mentor we <span>created a workflow that would allow us to work efficiently.</span>\n        We used the <span>agile methodology</span> to create the website. We had daily standups and we used the scrum board to keep track of our progress. \n        In the end we were able to create a website that was able to test out the use cases. ",
    "spinakerResult": "This project was a great experience. <span>I was able to work with students from all over Europe and I was able to learn a lot about the agile methodology. </span>\n        Not only was the project a great experience but I also got to visit the beautiful city of Katowice and made some new friends from all over Europe who I will visit later this year.\n        Definitely a recommendation for anyone who is interested in software development and wants to learn more about marketing and advertising.",

    "commonEuropeIntro": "I’ve always had a deep interest for IT and everything\n    within it. When I first heard about the IBM congress in Alicante I was very excited to learn about\n    everything it had to offer. In the education i already had, we don’t learn about infrastructure, databases,\n    and power systems in the same way that companies do. That made this an amazing learning\n    opportunity to better my knowledge in these subjects.",
    "commonEuropeGoal": "Before attending such an event, I had a thorough look at everything it had to offer. The main goal was to learn as much as possible in usefull subjects.\n    I took a particular interest in three different sessions. The first one was about the Data centric - Moving Business Logic into the Database. \n    I was very interested in this subject because it made me think outside of the box. Normally you would think application-centered and not database-centered. Or atleast not in the same way.\n    \n    The second subject I took interest in was about Kafka and Node.js. I had a basic understanding of Node.js but I wanted to learn more about it.\n    I hadn't heard about Kafka yet and was very excited to hear that it helped with integrating event streaming platforms with Javascript.\n    \n    The last subject was about DevSecOps. I didn't have much knowledge about this subject but I was very interested in it. I wanted to learn more about it and how it could help me in the future.\n    The DevSecOps was specifically on IBM systems, which i've never been able to interact with before. That definitely made it more interesting.",
    "commonEuropeCourse": "When we arrived at the congress, we were greeted by the IBM staff. They were very friendly and made us feel welcome. We were given a tour of the congress and were shown where everything was.\n    We were also given a schedule of all the sessions that were going to take place. We were able to choose which sessions we wanted to attend. We were also given a badge that \n    we could use to scan in and out of the sessions. This was very useful because it allowed us to keep track of the sessions we attended and the ones we didn't. \n    I attended a total of 3 sessions. All of them were very interesting and I learned a lot from them. I was able to take a lot of notes and I was able to ask questions to the speakers.\n    I also participated in some leisure activities of the congress, such as golfing. I was able to meet a lot of new people and make some new friends. We finished\n    the congress with a nice dinner and a party.",
    "commonEuropeResult": "I was able to learn alot at this congress, not only about IBM infrastructure and systems, but also about the Spanish culture and the city of Alicante.\n    The congress allowed me to meet new people and put a foot in the door of IBM. I hope to be able to work with IBM systems sometime in the future.",

I added styled-components to the project\n    to make it easier to style the website. I also added a few other libraries to the project to make it easier to create certain components. For example I used react-helmet-async\n    to <span>add meta tags and page titles to the website to optimise my SEO and SEA.</span> I chose these technologies not only for the advantages they bring but also because \n    <span>I wanted to learn more about them.</span>",
